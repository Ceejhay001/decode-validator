# decode-validator

A decentralized identity validation and reputation management system built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts.

## Overview

Decode Validator is a robust blockchain-based platform that provides secure identity verification, reputation tracking, and trustworthiness assessment for users across decentralized applications.

## Core Features

- Decentralized user identity verification
- Reputation scoring and tier system
- Authorized verification process
- Transparent reputation management
- Secure user profile creation and updates

## Smart Contract: Identity Validator

The core contract manages user identities, reputation tracking, and verification processes.

Key Functions:
- `create-profile`: Establish a new user profile
- `update-profile`: Modify existing profile details
- `verify-identity`: Validate user identities through authorized verifiers
- `submit-review`: Allow users to provide reputation feedback
- `get-user-reputation`: Retrieve user's current reputation status

## Getting Started

To use Decode Validator, you'll need:
1. A Stacks-compatible wallet
2. STX tokens for transaction fees
3. Access to verified validator network

## Usage Example

### Creating a Profile
```clarity
(contract-call? .identity-validator create-profile 
    "username"
    "user bio")
```

### Verifying a User
```clarity
(contract-call? .identity-validator add-verifier 
    verifier-principal)
```

## Security Considerations

- Strict access controls for profile management
- Authorized verifier system
- Reputation tier calculations
- Input validation for all operations
- Immutable verification records
